# roll-the-dice
GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as they want. Each result get added to his total score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, their current score goes to 0. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that the current score gets added to the global score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on total score wins the game
A player can also set a new winning score by entering a new final score and pressing Hold. This changes the final score and becomes the next players turn.

The winner hears praise from a gentle farmer.
